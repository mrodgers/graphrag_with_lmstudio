{"result": " High Availability is a critical feature or configuration that ensures the continuity of operations for various systems, particularly in the context of threat defense. It can be implemented as part of the application configuration or as a network setup. In the network context, High Availability involves having a standby unit ready to take over during failover to maintain uninterrupted availability of services. This is achieved through real-time data replication between primary and secondary units for fault tolerance. However, it's important to note that High Availability is not supported with clustering. In summary, High Availability is a system configuration designed to prevent service interruptions by ensuring redundancy and failover capabilities.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
