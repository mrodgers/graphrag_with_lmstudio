{"result": " The \"CLUSTER METRICS\" refer to a metric group in the cluster health monitor. This group is responsible for tracking statistics related to a cluster and its nodes. More specifically, it monitors various aspects of the cluster's performance, including CPU usage, memory usage, data throughput, CCL throughput, active connections, NAT translations, connection distribution, and packet distribution. The event related to this metric group is triggered every second for the purpose of recording these statistics.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
