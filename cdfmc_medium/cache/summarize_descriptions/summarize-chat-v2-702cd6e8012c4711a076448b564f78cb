{"result": " The \"DATA INTERFACE\" refers to various types of interfaces used for managing and transferring data in different contexts. Specifically, it can be described as an interface utilized for data transmission within a network. In some instances, it is a component of the Threat Defense Application that may fail, leading to clustering issues. Additionally, it serves as a specific interface for management connectivity. The Data Interface can also be configured with secondary interfaces for redundancy and is distinct from the Management interface. Furthermore, in the context of CDO, it refers to an interface used for managing data traffic. It has a default value of 3 for the number of rejoin attempts and 5 minutes between attempts. Overall, the Data Interface plays a crucial role in facilitating data transfer and management within various systems and applications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
