{"result": " Firewall Threat Defense is a cloud-delivered firewall management service provided by Cisco Defense Orchestrator. It is a security solution that can be managed and used for managing and defending against network threats, specifically firewall threats. The technology is designed to manage and secure firewalls using Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center in Cisco Defense Orchestrator. Firewall Threat Defense refers to the process of managing and mitigating firewall threats using this center. It also involves securing networks against unauthorized access or malicious activity through the use of firewalls. The technology can be managed using SNMP in Cisco Defense Orchestrator, and it is a specific security event or feature related to managing firewalls in the cluster. Firewall Threat Defense is an essential component of Cisco's defense strategy for securing networks against threats.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
