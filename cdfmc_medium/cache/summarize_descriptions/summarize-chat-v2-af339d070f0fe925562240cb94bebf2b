{"result": " Threat Defense refers to a security organization or system that protects against various threats and attacks on networks. It can be managed through the Management Center, CLI, or Firewall Management Center in Cisco Defense Orchestrator. Threat Defense is a technology or device that uses SSL and TLS protocols for secure message transmission during Remote Access VPN connections. It supports Object Group Search and provides security services such as SSL settings configuration and VPN endpoint deployment options. Threat Defense also uses DDNS to update IP addresses with a DNS provider and can be clustered on models like Firepower 9300. It is responsible for managing network security, translating IP addresses, securing IPv4 and IPv6 networks using VTEP and VXLAN encapsulation, and enforcing ICMP access rules. Threat Defense is a system that can be managed and defended against unauthorized access or attacks, with configurations and settings that can be rolled back if necessary. It is also responsible for identifying and mitigating potential security threats and implementing security measures to protect networks. Additionally, Threat Defense is mentioned as an application instance type that can be run on the Firepower 9300 and a device being managed through Cisco Defense Orchestrator. Overall, Threat Defense is a comprehensive security solution designed to manage and defend against network threats.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
