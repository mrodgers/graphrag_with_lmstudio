{"result": " Data Interfaces refer to specific interfaces within a system or cluster that serve various functions. They are crucial components of networking devices, transmitting and receiving data. In the context of High Availability for Threat Defense, Data Interfaces act as failover and state links. However, it is important to note that these interfaces have certain limitations and requirements for configuration. Additionally, during the restoration process, some Data Interfaces may be disconnected.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
