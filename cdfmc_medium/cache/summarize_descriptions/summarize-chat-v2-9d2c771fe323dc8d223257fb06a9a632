{"result": " Onboard Devices refer to the physical hardware components of a system, specifically those that are directly integrated into a server or computer. This term is also used in the context of adding new devices, such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, to Google Cloud Platform using Cisco Defense Orchestrator. In the former sense, onboard devices are integral parts of the computing infrastructure that cannot be easily removed or upgraded without accessing the hardware itself. In the latter sense, onboarding devices involves integrating them into an existing system or platform, allowing for their management and utilization.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
