{"result": " The Central Processing Unit (CPU), a crucial component of a computer system, is a measure of its processing power. This metric is monitored closely for utilization and usage by various processes and physical cores. A dashboard display provides an overview of CPU utilization, illustrating the percentage of usage by individual processes and the number of active physical cores. The Cisco Secure Firewall also reports on CPU utilization as one of its metrics.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
