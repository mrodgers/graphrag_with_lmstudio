{"result": " The Control Node and Data Nodes are essential components of a clustered firewall system. The Control Node holds the primary role in managing and overseeing the operations of multiple Data Nodes within the network cluster. It sets configuration settings for the Data Nodes, manages and replicates license settings to each node, and routes and replicates routing information to ensure all nodes are synchronized. Data Nodes join the cluster and adopt the Configuration from the Control Node, allowing them to function effectively as part of the system.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
