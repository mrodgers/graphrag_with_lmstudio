{"result": " The \"FAILOVER LINK\" refers to a backup communication path utilized to maintain connectivity between two units or devices in the event of a primary link failure. This link serves as an essential redundancy mechanism, ensuring uninterrupted communication and minimizing potential downtime. During normal operations, the failover link remains idle; however, it becomes active when the primary link experiences an outage. The activation process is typically automatic, allowing for seamless transition between the primary and backup links. In the context of Threat Defense Devices, a failover link facilitates failover operations to ensure continued security services during link failures.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
