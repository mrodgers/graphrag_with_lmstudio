{"result": " High Availability refers to a feature or state ensured by FTD devices, as well as a configurable setting within the Threat Defense application, that guarantees continued operation in case of failure. This concept is also applied to network configurations, where it ensures continuity by having standby units ready to take over during failover. High Availability is not limited to switch ports and is a networking concept designed to prevent traffic from passing through standby units while ensuring the continuous availability of network services. It is a system configuration that ensures the continuous operation of critical services, as indicated by the mention of 'high availability' and 'HA peering'. High Availability is an event or concept related to ensuring uninterrupted availability of services and is supported between same-type modules in Firepower 9300. It is a design that ensures minimal downtime and maximum uptime, often achieved through real-time data replication between primary and secondary units for fault tolerance. High Availability can be implemented as a system or network design where two devices work together to ensure continuous operation of an application or service. However, it is not supported with clustering.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
