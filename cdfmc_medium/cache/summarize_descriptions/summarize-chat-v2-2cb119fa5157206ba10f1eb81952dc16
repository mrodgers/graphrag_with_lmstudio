{"result": " Interface Object Optimization is a feature of the Firepower Management Center that streamlines device configuration and enhances deployment performance. By deploying single rules per access control or prefilter rule rather than separate rules for each source/destination interface pair, this optimization simplifies interface object management and improves overall system efficiency. Additionally, Interface Object Optimization optimizes interface objects to deliver better performance.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
