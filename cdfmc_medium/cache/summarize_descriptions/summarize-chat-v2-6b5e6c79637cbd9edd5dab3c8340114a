{"result": " Data Nodes refer to individual nodes within a device cluster, each responsible for consuming separate licenses for specific features. Once configured, they join the cluster and adopt the configuration from the Control Node. Data Nodes function as roles handling data processing while adhering to the configuration set by the Control Node. It is important to note that Data Nodes must not have any VPN configured for clustering. These nodes are components in a data center where data is processed and transmitted, relying on the Control Node for coordination. Additionally, Data Nodes can also refer to organizations or devices that store and process data within a network.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
