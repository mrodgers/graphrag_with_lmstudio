{"result": " The Control Node serves as the central managing entity for all Data Nodes in a cluster. It is responsible for determining configurations, handling specific features, and ensuring proper functioning of the Data Nodes within the network. The Control Node sets configuration settings for Data Nodes and communicates with them to maintain their optimal performance. Additionally, it populates Security Group Tags (SGT) information to Data Nodes for making match decisions based on security policies.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
