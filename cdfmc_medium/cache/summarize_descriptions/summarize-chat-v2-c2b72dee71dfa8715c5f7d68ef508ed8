{"result": " The term \"Configuration\" refers to two distinct concepts related to the Snort intrusion detection system. Firstly, it denotes the process of deploying new settings for Snort, leading to its restart. This configuration update results in modifications to Snort's behavior and functionality. Secondly, Configuration also encompasses the settings and information stored on a device or system that can be exported and imported using the Import/Export feature.
