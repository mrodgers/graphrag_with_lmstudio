{"result": " The \"CONFIG-SYNC OPTIMIZATION\" feature is a significant enhancement described in the text, which facilitates faster High Availability (HA) peering for data centers. This optimization plays a crucial role in improving configuration synchronization during failover events. By implementing Config-Sync Optimization, the need for full configuration synchronization during rejoin is eliminated, thereby reducing maintenance windows and upgrade times.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
