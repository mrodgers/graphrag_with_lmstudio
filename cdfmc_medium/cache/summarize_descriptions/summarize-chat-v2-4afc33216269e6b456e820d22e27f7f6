{"result": " The \"ACTIVE UNIT\" and \"STANDBY UNIT\" are components of a high availability setup where the Active Unit is currently in operation, managing primary functions, while the Standby Unit waits to take over in case of failure. During failover, an Active Unit can be replaced by its corresponding Standby Unit. These units function as high availability pairs, with the Active Unit's configuration being synchronized to the Standby Unit for readiness. Contradictory information suggests that when the Standby Unit fails, the Active Unit does not attempt to failover; however, this may depend on the specific high availability setup and configurations in place.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
