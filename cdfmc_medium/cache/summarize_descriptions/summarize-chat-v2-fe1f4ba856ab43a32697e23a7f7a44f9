{"result": " The CPU, or central processing unit, is a crucial component in any computing system that is closely monitored for its utilization and usage by processes and physical cores. This can be visualized through a dashboard display, which provides an overview of CPU usage, including the percentage of utilization by individual processes and the number of active cores. The CPU's importance is further emphasized by Cisco Secure Firewall, which includes its utilization as one of the metrics it provides.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
