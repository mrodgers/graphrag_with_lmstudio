{"result": " Interfaces refer to both data interfaces and network interfaces that serve various functions within different contexts. In the context of QoS rules, interfaces are components where rate limiting can be applied specifically. For data interfaces, they may need to be configured for clustering purposes. The term \"interfaces\" also encompasses physical or virtual connections between devices in a network and those managed by Cisco Defense Orchestrator. Additionally, network interfaces' status and traffic statistics are metrics provided by Cisco Secure Firewall.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
