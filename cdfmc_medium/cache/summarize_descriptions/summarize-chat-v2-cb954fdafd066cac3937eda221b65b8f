{"result": " VNI Interfaces refers to a network organization or a set of virtual interfaces, depending on the context. In one sense, VNI Interfaces is an entity that offers virtual interfaces as a service to keep network traffic segregated. In another sense, these interfaces are specific implementations used within VXLAN technology for implementing security policies. Thus, VNI Interfaces function as crucial components in both network organization and networking technology.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
