{"result": " The \"DATA INTERFACE\" refers to a versatile type of interface utilized for both data transfer and manager access in various contexts. It can be configured with secondary interfaces for redundancy and is employed for managing data access and configuration. In the Manager Access Interface, it is an option that can be selected. The Data Interface is also used for data transmission and mentioned specifically in certain texts. Additionally, it serves as a method of manager access to manage the standby unit during high availability pair breaks. Furthermore, it is a network interface used for managing data traffic in the context of CDO. Previously, it was also identified as a specific interface used for data transfer and replacement for the Management interface.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
