{"result": " The \"DATA INTERFACE\" refers to a specific type of network interface used for both data transfer and manager access. It can be configured with secondary interfaces for redundancy and is mentioned in various contexts as an interface used for managing data access and configuration. In some instances, it is noted as the new interface type chosen to replace the Management interface. The Data Interface is a versatile interface that supports data transfer and plays a crucial role in manager connectivity within specific systems such as CDO.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
