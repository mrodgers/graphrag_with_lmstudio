{"result": " Threat Defense refers to a security technology or system managed by the Management Center, used for securing networks against unauthorized access and attacks. It is a feature that provides protection against various threats and attacks, with configurations and settings that can be managed through the Management Center, CLI, or Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center. Threat Defense devices require management center intervention when data interface settings are changed locally on devices.\n\nThreat Defense is a model or system that supports Object Group Search and can be used in relation to backups and restoring. It is mentioned multiple times in the text with various configurations and settings, and is also used for managing and defending against network threats. Threat Defense is a device that needs to reach the management center through the data interface for management.\n\nThreat Defense is a security solution managed by the Management Center and can be clustered on various models including Firepower 9300. It is a technology used for identifying and mitigating potential threats to a network, and is also an event or process related to security and defense against potential threats. Threat Defense is a managing firewall organization that provides VPN endpoint, IKE, IPsec, and advanced site-to-site VPN deployment options.\n\nThreat Defense can be changed management interface and manager IP address following specific steps, and it is a technology or system mentioned in relation to security and protection against potential threats. It is also a security technology used for managing and defending against network threats, and is likely a security organization or system that manages network security. Threat Defense refers to the ability of a firewall or other security system to identify and mitigate potential threats to a network, and is a device with a management interface and a manager IP address that can be changed following specific steps.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
