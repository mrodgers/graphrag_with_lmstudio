{"result": " The \"TRANSLATED SOURCE\" refers to the network group or the location where the mapped addresses are translated to during a networking process. Specifically, it serves as the originating address in the client-server model of communication, which is replaced with the address of the network gateway or NAT (Network Address Translation) device for security reasons or due to limited public IP addresses.
