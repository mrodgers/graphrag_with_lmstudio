{"result": " The NODE entity refers to individual devices or components within a cluster, performing various roles and functions. Nodes are integral parts of the cluster, responsible for managing its tasks and following procedures during topology changes. They receive and process packets, including SYN packets, for new connections. Nodes can be deleted from one Management Center and added back to another. When part of the Threat Defense Application cluster, nodes may experience failures and require manual rejoining. Overall, NODE entities are singular devices or components within a network or cluster that play crucial roles in their respective systems.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
