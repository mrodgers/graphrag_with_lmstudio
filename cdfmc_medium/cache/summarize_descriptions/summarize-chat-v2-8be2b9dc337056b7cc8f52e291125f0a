{"result": " The term \"Interface Debounce Time\" refers to the duration before a node in a cluster considers an interface to have failed and takes action such as removing it from the cluster. This timeframe is crucial for preventing unnecessary interface fluctuations that could impact network stability. Therefore, Interface Debounce Time signifies the length of time a node waits before recognizing and responding to interface failures.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
