{"result": " Cluster Nodes refer to the individual devices or locations that make up a group or organization in various contexts. In some instances, they are devices that require proper configuration to form a cluster, possibly representing physical servers or data centers. Other descriptions indicate that Cluster Nodes are nodes or locations managed by Cisco Defense Orchestrator, with some of these nodes using a pool of IP addresses for their interfaces, including the control node. Additionally, Cluster Nodes can refer to the geographical locations where devices in the cluster are physically situated. The process of deploying nodes to form a network management cluster is also referred to as Cluster Nodes deployment. Lastly, Cluster Nodes send heartbeat messages to determine system health within the cluster.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
