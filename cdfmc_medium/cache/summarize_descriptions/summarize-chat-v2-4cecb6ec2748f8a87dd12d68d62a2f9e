{"result": " The term \"FTD\" refers to Firewall Threat Defense, a technology or system utilized for managing and securing networks against various threats. This technology can be configured and managed using Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO). FTD devices have different management requirements; some may need configuration changes for their management interfaces to work with data interfaces, while others might require re-cabling for the CDO to reach them on the new management interface. High availability configurations are also supported for FTD devices managed by CDO. It is important to note that in certain cases, there might be a block on CDO's employment that needs to be removed for access to FTD technology. Additionally, FTD can route data through interfaces and may need configuration adjustments to do so effectively with the CDO.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
