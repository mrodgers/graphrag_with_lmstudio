It synchronizes its configuration and state information with the Active Unit to ensure seamless failover. In the event of a failure, the Standby Unit takes over the responsibilities of the Active Unit, assuming its functions and maintaining continuity of services. The location of the Standby Unit serves as a backup site where the failover command can take control if necessary.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
