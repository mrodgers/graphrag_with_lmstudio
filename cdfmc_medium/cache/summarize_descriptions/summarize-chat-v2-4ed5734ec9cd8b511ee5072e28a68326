{"result": " The \"SECONDARY UNIT\" is a network component that serves as a standby device in various configurations, including failover pairs and high availability systems. When the primary unit experiences interruptions, the secondary unit becomes the active unit, assuming its roles and using its IP addresses and MAC addresses. This can result in duplicate addresses and disruptions to network traffic. However, during normal operations, the secondary unit remains synchronized with the primary unit's policies without actively passing traffic. In high availability configurations, the secondary unit utilizes the active IP address.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
