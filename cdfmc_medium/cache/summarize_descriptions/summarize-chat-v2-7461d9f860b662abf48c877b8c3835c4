{"result": " The THREAT DEFENSE DEVICES refer to a group of security systems that can be managed and analyzed through CDO (Cisco Defense Orchestrator). These devices can be configured for backup and restoration using the Command Line Interface (CLI). They are onboarded to CDO for centralized management and analysis. Threat Defense Devices send event data to either the Secure Network Analytics Manager or the Cisco Secure Network Analytics Flow Collector and Data Store for further analysis. As hardware components used for securing networks against threats, they require identification for high availability configuration and can be managed by both the Management Center and CDO.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
