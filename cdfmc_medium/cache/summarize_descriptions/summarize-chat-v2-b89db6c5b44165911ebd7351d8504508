{"result": " The DATA NODES are essential components of a cluster, serving multiple functions in processing and managing data. Specifically, they process data and adhere to instructions from the Control Node. In addition, Data Nodes store and process data within the cluster, with the ability to be removed if they fail to receive packets from the Control Node. These nodes are also responsible for sharing the same configuration and handling regular traffic within the cluster, while following the configuration set by the Control Node.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
