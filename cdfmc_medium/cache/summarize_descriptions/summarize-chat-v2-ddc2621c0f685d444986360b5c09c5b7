{"result": " The term \"INTERFACES\" refers to a collection of data interfaces and network interfaces that play various roles in different contexts. These interfaces can be found on Cisco Secure Firewall, where they are monitored for status and aggregate traffic statistics. Interfaces are also components used in Quality of Service (QoS) rules, enabling rate limiting to be applied specifically to certain interfaces. In the context of clustering, interfaces need to be configured for data exchange between nodes. Furthermore, network interfaces managed by Cisco Defense Orchestrator and those used for packet translation are also included in this definition.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
