{"result": " The term \"Managing Firewall Threat Defense\" refers to the process of managing and securing networks against unauthorized access or malicious activity using Cisco Defense Orchestrator and Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center. This event involves configuring and managing firewalls, managing and defending against firewall threats, and securing devices and networks. The use of Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center is a key component in this process, enabling the management of threats and the deployment of changes to firewall policies. The main objective is to ensure effective firewall security and protect against network threats. The discussions around Managing Firewall Threat Defense may also include the configuration of settings for the Firewall Threat Defense technology and managing firewall settings using Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center in Cisco Defense Orchestrator. It should be noted that changes to the firewall policy are not active until they are deployed.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
