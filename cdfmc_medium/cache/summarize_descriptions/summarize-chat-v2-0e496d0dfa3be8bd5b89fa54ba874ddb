{"result": " The entity referred to as \"SUNRPC\" is described as an application inspection in FlexConfig, a protocol for implementing remote procedure calls over a network, and a method used for executing functions on a remote computer. Thus, SUNRPC functions as a crucial mechanism for facilitating communication between different systems and enabling the execution of remote procedures across a network. Its role in network routing is also significant, as it may be subject to routing requirements.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
