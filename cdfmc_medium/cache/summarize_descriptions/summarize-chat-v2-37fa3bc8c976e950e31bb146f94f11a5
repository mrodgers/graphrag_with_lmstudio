{"result": " The Active/Standby Failover is a process involving two threat defense devices. In this setup, one device acts as the active unit, handling traffic and processing security functions, while the other serves as the standby unit. When the active unit fails or encounters issues, the standby unit takes over its functionality to ensure uninterrupted network protection. Simultaneously, the standby unit synchronizes its configuration and state information with the failed unit to prepare for seamless transition back to a standby role once the active unit is restored.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
