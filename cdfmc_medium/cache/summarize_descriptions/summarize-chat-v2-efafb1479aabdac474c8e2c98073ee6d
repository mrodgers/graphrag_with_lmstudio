{"result": " The \"FIREPOWER 9300\" entity refers to a specific model of networking equipment produced by Cisco, which can be used for network security clustering. This device supports Hardware Bypass and has multiple modules that can participate in a cluster and run native or container instances. The Firepower 9300 is a technology or device model that requires all three modules to belong to a cluster and can support a maximum capacity of 16 modules. It is also used in High Availability configurations and comes with one SM-44 interface and multiple subinterfaces. Contradictory descriptions suggesting that the Firepower 9300 is a geographical location or a specific model of a security device used in clustering have been resolved, as the entity clearly refers to a network security device produced by Cisco.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
