{"result": " SNMP, also known as the Simple Network Management Protocol, is a widely used protocol for managing and monitoring networked devices. It enables network administrators to collect and modify information about managed devices on IP networks in a uniform way. SNMP supports various versions including 1, 2c, and 3, and is employed by Threat Defense for network monitoring. The technology is configured with intrusion policies that send alerts from managed devices when health event levels occur.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
