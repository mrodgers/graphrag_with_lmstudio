{"result": " The \"INTRUSION POLICY\" refers to a set of rules that governs the behavior of a network security system in detecting and responding to unauthorized access or malicious activity. It is a specific type of policy designed for intrusion detection and response. Intrusion policies can be automated with recommendations based on network discovery data, and they are subject to change. These policies can be imported and exported, but their shared layers and default variable sets may cause unexpected behavior. Overall, intrusion policies play a crucial role in securing networks by setting rules for detecting and responding to potential intrusions.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
