{"result": " High Availability refers to a feature or state ensured by FTD devices, as well as a configurable setting within the Threat Defense application, designed to maintain continuous operation in case of failure. This can be achieved through network configurations that have standby units ready for failover, preventing traffic from passing through during such events while ensuring continuity. High Availability is also a term used to describe system configurations that ensure the continuous operation of critical services, as indicated by the mention of 'high availability' and 'HA peering'. It can be supported between same-type modules in Firepower 9300 and may involve data replication in real-time between primary and secondary units for fault tolerance. Additionally, High Availability can refer to a system where two devices work together to ensure continuous operation of an application or service, and is a deployment configuration that provides redundancy and failover capabilities.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
