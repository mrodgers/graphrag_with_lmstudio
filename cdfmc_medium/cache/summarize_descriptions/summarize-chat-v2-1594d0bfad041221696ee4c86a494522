{"result": " The \"FIREPOWER 9300\" refers to a specific model of security technology or product produced by Cisco. It is capable of being used as a standalone device with one SM-44 interface and multiple subinterfaces, or as part of a cluster with other compatible modules. The Firepower 9300 can support multiple SM-44 modules and has a maximum capacity of 16 modules in a cluster. It is important to note that it cannot be mixed with the Firepower 4100 in the same cluster.\n\nThis technology is used in the context of security and requires all modules belonging to a cluster to be of the same type. The Firepower 9300 can be used as a logical device in Cisco Defense Orchestrator and comes in different models, including SM-56, SM-48, and SM-40. It is also capable of running native or container instances and supporting multiple application instances within the same chassis.\n\nAdditionally, the Firepower 9300 may refer to a specific geographical location or model of threat defense device supported in High Availability configurations. However, based on the provided descriptions, it appears that this interpretation is less likely than the previous one.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
