Additionally, there is mention of this child being a little girl who comes to bring Scrooge home permanently. These descriptions suggest that \"\"FAN\"\" is an enthusiastic and possibly devoted fan or admirer of Master Scrooge, who looks forward to his return and may play a role in ensuring that he stays with them.\",3\n48,\"\"\"MASTER SCROOGE\"\"\",\" Master Scrooge is a character who is warmly welcomed home by a child named Fan. Upon his return, he is greeted with joy and excitement. However, after this description, there is another account stating that Master Scrooge is conveyed by the schoolmaster to a best parlour, which implies that he may have been in a state of shivering cold before entering the room. It's possible that the child Fan was present in the best parlour and greeted him there to provide warmth and comfort after his arrival or after being conveyed by the schoolmaster.
