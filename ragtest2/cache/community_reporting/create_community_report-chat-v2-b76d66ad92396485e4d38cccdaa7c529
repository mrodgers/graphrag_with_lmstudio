Known for his unapproachable demeanor and preference for solitude, Scrooge is described as having a hardened heart and begrudging those around him, including his employees. Despite this, Scrooge undergoes a significant transformation throughout the story.\n\nScrooge experiences various emotions, from relief and gratitude after a false alarm to terror in the presence of spectres. He encounters several people from his past, including Marley, who appears as a ghost to warn him of the consequences of his miserly ways. Scrooge is shown the past instead of the holidays and is visited by a little girl named Fan.\n\nThe character experiences nostalgia and emotion in a melancholic room, recalling memories from his past. He expresses ill-will towards Marley's Ghost initially but later comes to understand its message. Scrooge takes precautions to ensure his home is secure before retiring for the night.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance, Scrooge ultimately experiences a transformation after encountering the spirit of Christmas. He expresses emotion towards Dick and recognizes and remembers various landmarks and people from his past. Scrooge locks himself in, takes off his cravat, puts on his dressing-gown and slippers, and sits before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nScrooge was once a business partner of Marley and is now dealing with his estate.
